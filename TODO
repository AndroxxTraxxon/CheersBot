Architecture
    Change to an event-stream model piped over server-side events
    Hydrate channels and users on-demand to reduce memory costs
    Split into plugins and separate data by plugin
        Enable/disable plugins using shared interface
        Each plugin gets one control panel section
    Create an actual homepage with links to register bots/channels/users

    Configure Bots

        Configure which bots have access via UI

    Configure Users
        Allow multiple users to be given access to the channel control panel (e.g. moderators, trusted users, alt accounts)
        Configure which users have access via UI

    Notification settings
        Trigger-via-timeout (mostly done)
            Still need configurable timer
        Grouping/merging options (add, replace, maximum, total)

Other Features (Long-Term)
    Viewer game drafting/raffle system
        Opt in via chat command, optionally giving context (competitive rank, etc.)
        Rules for randomly selecting participants
            Randomly from first X viewers in queue
            Chance multipliers for followers/subs
        Choose to move to back of queue or remove from queue
        Make sure viewers aren't counted multiple times
    Chat vote system (not really necessary, but could be fun to do for a "complete package" overlay)
    VOD review queue (Overwatch)
        Maybe work for generic queues of items (although Overwatch-specific functionality can be a submode)
    Twitch-integrated VRM-compatible games


Girl DM Ideas
    Evil counter - Done!
        When a say redeem happens, look for the keywords "evil" or "war crimes"
        If you find it, add to the "evil_dm_" counter

Bugs
    Hitting "Complete" and then "Thoroughly patted" in short succession causes the counter to go negative
    Users need access to the default channel ('hawkbar') to be able to use their own control panels
